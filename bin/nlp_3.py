# Certainly! Here's an example of how to implement custom training logic in your ChatterBot trainer:


class MyTrainer(ListTrainer):
    def __init__(self, chatbot):
        super().__init__(chatbot)

    def train(self, conversation):
        for statement_text, response_text in conversation:
            statement = Statement(text=statement_text)
            response = Statement(text=response_text)
            self.chatbot.storage.update(statement)
            self.chatbot.storage.update(response)


# Create a new chat bot
bot = ChatBot('MyBot')

# Create a new instance of your custom trainer
my_trainer = MyTrainer(bot)

# Define your own conversational data to train the bot
conversational_data = [
    ("Hello!", "Hi there!"),
    ("How are you doing?", "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!"),
    ("What's your favorite color?", "My favorite color is blue."),
    ("What do you like to do for fun?",
     "I like to read books and go for walks in nature."),
    ("Do you have any pets?", "No, I don't have any pets. How about you?"),
    ("I have a dog named Charlie.", "That's cool. Dogs are great pets!"),
    ("Goodbye!", "Take care!"),
]

# Train the bot using your custom trainer and conversational data
my_trainer.train(conversational_data)


"""
In this example, we create a new custom trainer by inheriting from the ListTrainer class. We then define our own implementation of the train() method to implement our custom training logic.

In this case, our custom training logic updates the bot's knowledge base with new statements and responses from the conversational data. We create a new Statement instance for each statement and response, and use the update() method of the bot's storage adapter to add them to the knowledge base.

Once we've defined our custom trainer, we can create a new instance of it and pass it to our ChatBot instance using the train() method. We also define our own conversational data to train the bot, which is passed to the train() method of our custom trainer.
